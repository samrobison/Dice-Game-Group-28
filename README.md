If a player chooses to call a bluff it will end the round. 
The player with the highest score will start the new round.
The game ends with the end of the third round.

###### Overview of Rules

In our game, some number of players between two and seven join a game composed of 3 rounds. In each round, the players are randomly assigned an order, and whichever player is currently winning (or has the most wins in the case of tied highest score, or has been randomly selected in the case of tied highest score and tied most wins) begins the round. (This person is hereinafter referred to as the "leader.") Each player rolls three six-sided dice. The leader then makes a claim about the summed value of their three rolled dice. This claim can be true or false. (This player is hereinafter referred to as the "claimant.") The player next to the claimant can say that the claimant is bluffing, or can decline to do so. If the bluff-caller declines to say that the claimant is bluffing, then the claimant's score is increased by the amount claimed as the summed value of the claimant's dice. (This claimed value is hereinafter referred to as "x.") If the bluff-caller does say that the claimant is bluffing, but the summed value is actually equal to x, then the claimant's score is increased by x*3/2 (using integer division), and the bluff-caller's score is reduced by x. Note that in no case can any player's score become less than 0. If the bluff-caller says that the claimant is bluffing, and the values of the claimant's dice do not in fact equal x, the claimant's score is reduced by x and the bluff-caller's score is increased by x. However, at the beginning of each game, each player comes into possession of an "immunity card." If the claimant's bluff if called correctly (the values of the claimant's dice do not add up to x), the claimant can play their immunity card, in which case the bluff-caller's score does not increase, nor does the claimant's score decrease. Each player can only use an immunity card once per game.

After the bluff-caller calls a bluff the round ends, a new order of players is randomly chosen, and a new leader is determined to begin the next round. If the person winning the game has not changed during the last round, this new leader is the same as the old leader. After 3 rounds have finished, whoever has the highest score wins the game.

If players are tied for the highest score after three rounds, these players go into an extra round-- an elimination round. The elimination round proceeds in exactly the same way as any other round, except that at the end of an elimination round, whichever player has the highest score wins the game. In the case of a tie, another elimination round is played under the same conditions. If, after three elimination rounds, no winner can be determined, a winner will be randomly chosen among the remaining contenders.

Players will be able to access the number of games that their competitors have won.
