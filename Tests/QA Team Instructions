Because our game is a Rails app, and because the gem we used to create the app places certain limits on testing, we had to talk to Corey
about what to do. He told us to write tests to cover as much as we could (you can find these tests in unitTestWatir.rb, and you can find
the output of these tests in UnitTestOutput.txt), and then to write instructions for an imaginary Quality Assurance Team to cover anything
left out. These instructions follow. (Note that I've tested all of this, and it works fine, at least by my findings)

game) navigate back to the homepage and then the player rankings page to make sure that your number of wins has remained the same. Then 
start a new game until you win one. Having won one (and only one), navigate back to the homepage and then the player rankings page.

Expected output: you should see that your number of wins has increased by 1 from what the number was when you began this test.

signed up. Once you've done this, press the "Start Game" button. Have the other human enter the URL of the game you've created
(for example, http://159.203.222.152:3000/games/207) into their computer/browser.

Expected output: the other human should see the same game that you do, and it should be their turn first. You two should then be able
to play a game as normal.

enter the URL of the game you've created (for example, http://159.203.222.152:3000/games/207) into their computer(s)/browser(s). Then
have everybody play through the game by only calling bluffs-- no calls will be made in this game. At the end of the game, everyone's
score should be zero.

Expected output: the game should list all the participants as winners.
