<h1>Playing our dice game</h1>

<p>To play the game, you must first enter the number of players in the game. Once you've done that, you should enter the number of human players. The remaining players will be AI. Currently, having more than one human player results in somewhat silly gameplay, because the summed value of each human player's dice is printed to standard output, and guessing the value of other players' dice is an integral part of the game. We intend to alter this functionality when we have the database and the GUI set up. As such, we recommend that only one human play, but the game will support multiple human players. Once you've entered the number of human players, human players must enter their names, and then the AI players are populated. The game then begins in earnest. The first player in the order assigned (for now, we have removed the dynamic ordering of players' turns; instead, one order of play is fixed throughout the game, beginning with human players and then moving to AI players) will see the results of rolling two dice. That player must then make a claim about the summed value of their dice. This claim can be true or false, but must be an integer between 1 and 12. The player who's after the first player in the established order can then choose to say that the first player is bluffing, or decline to do so. If the first player was bluffing, and the next player correctly accuses the first player of bluffing, then the accusing player's score is increased by the value that the first player claimed to have, and the first player's score is reduced by that value. However, all players' scores start at zero, and in no case can a player's score dip below zero. If the first player was not bluffing, but the next player accuses the first player of doing so, then the first player's score is increased by three times the amount claimed (accurately) by the first player, divided by two using integer division. The accuser's score is reduced by the amount that the first player rolled. If the next player does not accuse the first player of bluffing, then the first player's score is increased by the amount claimed, regardless of its accuracy. The next player's score does not change in this case. This complete's the first player's turn. Then the next player rolls dice, and the process begins over again,going through the established order until each player has made a claim about their dice and either accused the player before them in the order of bluffing or declined to do so. When each player has played these roles, the first round ends, and the second begins. The second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds operate exactly as the first one did. The game ends after five rounds. Whichever player has the highest score at that point wins. In the event of a tie, the players who were tied for the high score roll dice to see who wins. If there is a tie for high score in this sudden-death roll-off, the results are scrapped, and the dice are rolled again until only one player has a high score (this is another change from before, to simplify tiebreaking).</p>

  <li> To play the game, you must enter the name of the game as well as the desired number of players for the game.</li> 
  <li> If you have more than 1 human player, enter the other player's emails where specified.</li>
  <li> The remaining player slots will be AI.</li>
  <li> The order of players is randomized.</li>
  <li> When it is your turn you will be presented with your dice total and two options: make a claim or call a bluff.</li>
  <li> When making a claim you will be have two courses of action: be honest or bluff.</li>
  <li> The other option is to call a bluff. You would call a bluff when you think the player before you is being dishonest.</li>
  <li> If you were correct about the person bluffing, you get 150% of the bluff total and the bluffer loses half of their score.</li>
